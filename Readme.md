# Crossword generator

## Generate a Crossword from a list of words.

## Goals
1. Create an algorithm that is efficient enough so that it can generate crosswords for 20 strings having upto 10 characters in milliseconds in my laptop.
2. Write the code in Typescript.
3. Use Express for a backend.
4. Host it for easy access.

## Design Choices
1. Vanilla CSS (At last an opportunity to learn it!).
2. Server Side Rendering (I think it's better for a simple project).
3. Strings instead of Characters as it can be used for indic languages also.

## Setup Instructions (If tsc is there)

Please let me know if these commands are not sufficient or there are any errors. I will try to fix them.

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/mssrprad/Crossword;
cd Crossword;
npm i;
npm run build && npm run start;
```
