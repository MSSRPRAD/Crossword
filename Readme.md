# Crossword generator

## Generate a Crossword from a list of words.

## Goals
1. Create an algorithm that is efficient enough so that it can generate crosswords for 20 strings having upto 10 characters in milliseconds in my laptop.
2. Write the code in Typescript.
3. Use Express for a backend.
4. Host it for easy access.

## Design Choices
1. Vanilla CSS (At last an opportunity to learn it!)
2. Server Side Rendering (I think it's better for a simple project)
